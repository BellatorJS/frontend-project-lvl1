**This project includes set of five games. Each game has 3 questions. To win, you need to answer all three questions in a row. If you answer incorrectly, the game ends. Good luck!**

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Clone a repository.**

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/BellatorJS/frontend-project-lvl1.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies.**

   ```bash
   $ make install
   ```
   
3. **Print the game's name in terminal and press "Enter" to launch it.**

   ```bash
   $ brain-even
   ```  


### List of the brain-games.

1. **Game: "Even check"**

    ```bash
   $ brain-even
   ``` 
    
* ðŸ“œ The game is generate a random number. You needs to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it is odd:
